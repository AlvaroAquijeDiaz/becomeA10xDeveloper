# **Become a 10X Developer in 3 months**

This guide is intended for beginners and primarily focused on Frontend _(see frontend/backend better explanation and differences [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRSyHTajxPk 'here'))_

&rarr; **Important side-notes**

- There&rsquo;s no need to pay for courses
- You don't need to watch every videos until the end
- Don't get frustated if you can't understand something at first glance, take your time and ...
- **Be patient**
- **Learn how to identify bugs and plan a solving strategy** &rarr; \*This shi\*_t is quite hard to master, I personally haven't yet _
- If you don't know some technology or piece of code explained on the videos, look it up on Google
- **_Please read the documentation websites for any technology or framework you choose to learn, there shall be most of the important features and quirks, if not ..._**
- Search if someone had a similar problem to yours, **StackOverflow recommended**

&rarr; **Requirements** - Install Node - Install Visual Studio Code, I may suggest some useful extensions

> - I personally just learnt the basics of React &rarr; functional components, hooks, etc; and quickly moved onto **Next.js** ‚ù§ (you'll see that routing, SSR and DX (developer experience) is far better here)

### Next Steps

Dive into fullstack web development and how to become one, learn other tech stacks such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ 'AWS'), serverless development, Rust programming language _(I'm currently learning it and seems nice!)_ and **reach out to me** &rarr; [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvaro-dev-ad/ 'linkedin') or [github](https://github.com/AlvaroAquijeDiaz 'github') whenever you have completed this guide _or if any link is broken or doesn't work_. Enjoy your ride ü§ñ!
